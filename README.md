# AutonomousVehicle

A project built on Unity (version 2020.3.18f1).

This is the final group project of my Computer Science Honors Degree with a Specialization in Game Development. 

This project was made in colobaration with my group which consisted of Massimo Albano, Ruturaj Darji and Xiaoyue Liang.

This project was about Simulation of autonomous vehicles in unity with emphasis on localization. An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that is able to navigate itself without any human interaction. The emphasis of this project is on the localization is the ability of the vehicle to pinpoint its lication with the map.
